<h1>What is The Bunch?</h1>

<p>The Bunch was born from the idea of creating a character to each mental disorder which a person may be suffering from. Just like us these stuffed toys go through the same problems a human beings could have. These can suffer from depression, anxiety, they may suffer from stage fright , another perhaps may be obsessive compulsive or even bipolar.
 
If these stuffed toys can admit they have a problem maybe this will make us understand that we are not alone.</p>
