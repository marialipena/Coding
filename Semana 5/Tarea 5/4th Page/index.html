<h1>Meet the Artist: Maria Alicia Peña Sarnelli</h1>

<img id="img3" src="Images/Mariali.gif" alt="Hola">

<p>This idea was born out of an animation I did on my first semester as a second year student in Altos de Chavon, there I talked about depression and what it meant to me; I named it "Depression Is...". The animation had a character named Lump, he was a little monster who for me lives inside all of us. In my animation ‘Lump’ would act out the scenes I would narrate.</p>
<br>
<p>As I began to work more and more on the project, Lump grew on me to the extent that I wanted to be with him all the time, so I decided that a I wanted to make him come alive, the best idea was to bring him to life as a plush toy. Every one loved him, so little by little I decided to make his family even bigger.</p>
</br>
<p>With these plush toys, I want to show the world that theres nothing to be afraid of, that there are a lot of people who go through these same processes and feelings. I also want to show the viewers that it is normal that he/she, a friend or family member is going through these situations and that it is not a negative thing to be or feel that way.</p>
